					<h2>My name is Brittany Pugh [BRIT-nee PYOO].</h2><br><br>
					
					<h5>WEB DEVELOPER.</h5>
					<h5>WORLD TRAVELER.</h5>
					<h5>LANGUAGE ENTHUSIAST.</h5>

					<p>I am a front-end web developer at <a href="https://www.boozallen.com" target="_blank">Booz Allen Hamilton</a> working remotely from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex Area. I write code for what the user sees on their screen and make visiting websites a fun, positive experience.<br><br>

					People often notice my curiosity for the world (obvious by the many questions I ask), talent for writing and ability to adapt to new situations. In my free time, I travel, read books and study Brazilian-Portuguese.</p>

					<h4>4 Awesome Facts About Me</h4>
					<div class="section">

								<h4>Fact #1</h4>
								<h5>I like challenging work.</h5>
								<p>I attended <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a> (NYU) for two years while enrolled in the five-year dual-degree program for Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. During the Fall of my Sophomore year, I studied abroad in London. While in London, I worked as a community service assistant planning volunteer events throughout London and neighboring Wales.</p>

								<h4>Fact #2</h4>
								<h5>I adapt well to change.</h5>
								<p>I transferred to <a href="https://www.southwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Southwestern University</a> after completing my Sophomore year at NYU. For my capstone project, I worked with eleven other students to build a scavenger hunt web application using Ruby on Rails. I graduated in May of 2015 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science.</p>

								<h4>Fact #3</h4>
								<h5>I have a knack for languages (not just the programming ones).</h5>
								<p>I have studied three Romance languages. I studied Spanish in college while completing a language immersion project in Georgetown, Texas. I studied Italian on my own for a year, learning at my own pace and practicing with native speakers. I have studied Brazilian-Portuguese for almost a year and a half. I continue to practice, learn new vocabulary and talk to native Brazilians.</p>
