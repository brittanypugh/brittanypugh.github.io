					<h3>WEB DEVELOPER.</h3>
					<h3>WORLD TRAVELER.</h3>
					<h3>LANGUAGE ENTHUSIAST.</h3>

					<p class="flow-text">My name is Brittany Pugh [BRIT-nee PYOO]. I am a front-end web developer at <a href="https://www.boozallen.com" target="_blank">Booz Allen Hamilton</a> working remotely from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex Area. I write code for what the user sees on their screen and make visiting websites a fun, positive experience.<br><br>

					People often notice my curiosity for the world (obvious by the many questions I ask), talent for writing and ability to adapt to new situations. In my free time, I travel, read books and study Brazilian-Portuguese.</p>
