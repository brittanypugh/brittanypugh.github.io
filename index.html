					<br>

					<p>I am a front-end web developer at <a href="https://www.boozallen.com" target="_blank">Booz Allen Hamilton</a> working remotely from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex Area. I write code for what the user sees on their screen and make visiting websites a fun, positive experience.<br><br> People often notice my curiosity for the world (obvious by the many questions I ask), talent for writing and ability to adapt to new situations. In my free time, I travel, read books and study Brazilian-Portuguese.</p>

						<h2 class="fact">Fact #1 </h2>
						<h3>I like challenging work.</h3>
						<p>I attended <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a> (NYU) for two years while enrolled in the 5-year dual-degree program for Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. During the Fall of my Sophomore year, I studied abroad in London. While in London, I worked as a community service assistant planning volunteer events throughout London and neighboring Wales.</p>

						<h3>I adapt well to change.</h3>
						<p>I transferred to <a href="https://www.southwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Southwestern University</a> after completing my Sophomore year at NYU. For my capstone project, I worked with eleven other students to build a scavenger hunt web application using Ruby on Rails. I graduated in May of 2015 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science.</p>

						<h2 class="fact">Fact #3</h2>
						<h3>I have a knack for languages (not just the programming ones).</h3>
						<p>I have studied three Romance languages. I learned Spanish in college while completing a language immersion project in Georgetown, Texas. I studied Italian on my own for a year, using various tools and practicing with native speakers. I have been learning Brazilian-Portuguese for almost a year and a half. Every day, I strive to learn new vocabulary and practice speaking with native Brazilians.</p>

					<div class="section">
						<h2 class="fact">Fact #4</h2>
						<h3>I enjoy traveling.</h3>
						<p>I have lived in various parts of the U.S. including the Silicon Valley, Washington D.C. area and New York City. Outside of the United States, I have traveled to England, Wales, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. I plan to visit Brazil next!</p>
