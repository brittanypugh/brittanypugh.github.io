# Portfolio Website by Brittany Pugh
## Description
My website has a brief summary about my skills and work experience. The website also directs users to my email, projects, GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile.
## Motivation
I created the website to introduce myself to other web developers and web users.
## Design
I created a clean, simple design using: 
- HTML (layout)
- CSS (style and animation)
- JavaScript (interaction)
- Materialize CSS (https://materializecss.com/)
- Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
