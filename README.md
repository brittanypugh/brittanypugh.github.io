# Portfolio Website by Brittany Pugh
## Description
My website has a brief summary about my skills and work experience. The website also directs users to my email, projects, GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile.
## Motivation
I created this website to introduce myself to other web developers and web users.
## Design
I created a clean, simple design using: 
- HTML (layout)
- CSS (style and animation)
- JavaScript (interaction)
- Materialize CSS (https://materializecss.com/)
- Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)

I used the following APIs to build two of my projects:
- DataMuse API, "a word-finding query engine for developers" (http://www.datamuse.com/api/)
- NYTimes Most Popular API, a query of trending NYTimes articles with the goal of "putting more information in the hands of the public" (https://developer.nytimes.com/)

For more information about APIs, you can read these articles:
- Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)
- HowToGeek (https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/)
